What do you need to know about water chemistry and why?

Water in nature is rarely pure in the "distilled water" sense; it contains dissolved salts, buffers, nutrients, etc., with exact concentrations dependent on local conditions. Fish (and plants) have evolved over millions of years to the specific water conditions in their native habitats and may be unable to survice in significantly different environments.

Beginners (and especially the lazy) should take the easy approach of selecting fish whose needs match the qualities of their normal tap water. Alternatively, an advanced (and energetic!) aquarist can change the water characteristics to match the fish's needs, though doing so is almomst always more difficult than first appears. In either case, you need to know enough about water chemistry to ensure that the water in your tank has the right properties for the fish you are keeping.

Water has four measurable properties that are commonly used to characterize its chemistry. They are:

   pH refers to water being either an acid, base, or neither (neutral). A pH of 7 is said to be neutral, pH's below 7 are "acidic" and pH's above 7 are "basic" or "alkaline". Like the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes, the pH scale is logarithmic. A pH of 5.5 is 10 times more acidic than water at a pH of 6.5. Thus, changing the pH by a small amount (suddenly) is more of a chemical change (and more stressful to fish!) than might first appear.

   To a fishkeeper, two aspects of pH are important. First, rapid changes in pH are stressful to fish and should be avoided. Changing the pH by more than .3 units per day is known to stress fish. Thus, you want the pH of your tank to remain constant and stable over the long haul. Second, fish have adapted to thrive in a (sometimes narrow) pH range. You want to be sure that your tank's pH matches the specific requirements of the fish you are keeping.

   Most fish can adjust to pHs somewhat outside of their optimal ranges. If your water's pH is naturally within the range of 6.5 to 7.5, you will be able to keep most species of fish without any problems. If your pH lies within this range, there is probably no need to adjust it upward or downward.
   Buffering capacity refers to water's ability to keep the pH stable as acids or bases are added. pH and buffering capacity are intertwined with one another; although one might think that adding equal volumes of an acid and neutral water would result in a pH halfway in between, this rarely happens in practice. If the water has sufficient buffering capacity, the buffering capacity can absorb and neutralize the added acid without significantly changing the pH. Conceptually, a buffer acts somewhat like a large sponge. As more acid is added, the "sponge" absorbs the acid without chaning the pH much. The "sponge's" capacity is limited however; once the buffering capacity is used up, pH changes more rapidly as acids are added.

   Buffering has both positive and negative consequences. On the plus side, the nitrification cycle produces nitric acid (nitrate). Without buffering, your tank's pH would drop over time (a bad thing). With sufficient buffering, the pH stays stable (a good thing). On the negative side, hard tap water often almost always has a large buffering capacity. If the pH of the water is too high for your fish, the buffering capacity makes it difficult to lower the pH to a more appropriate value. Naive attempts to change the pH of water usually fail because buffering effects are ignored.

   In freshwater aquariums, most of water's buffering capacity is due to carbonates and bicarbonates. Thus, the terms "carbonate hardness" (KH), "alkalinity" and "buffering capacity" are used interchangably. Although technically not the same things, they are equivalent in practice in the context of fishkeeping. Note: the term "alkalinity" should not be confused with the term "alkaline". Alkalinity refers to buffering, while akaline refers to a solution that is a base (e.g., pH > 7).

   How much buffering does your tank need? Most aquarium buffering capacity test kits actually measure KH. The larger the KH, the more resistant to pH changes your water will be. A tank's KH should be high enough to prevent large pH swings in your tank over time. If your KH is below roughly 4.5 dH, you should pay special attention to your tank's pH (e.g, test weekly, until you get a feel for how stable the pH is). This is ESPECIALLY important if you neglect to do frequent partial water changes. In particular, the nitrification cycle creates a tendency for an established tank's pH to decrease over time. The exact amount of pH change depends on the quantity and rate of nitrates produced, as well as the KH. If your pH drops more than roughly a two tenths of a point over a month, you should consider increasing the KH or performing partial water changes more frequently. KH doesn't affect fish directly, so there is no need to match fish species to a particular KH.

   Note: it is not a good idea to use distilled water in your tank. By definition, distilled water has essentially no KH. That means that adding even a little bit of acid will change the pH significantly (stressing fish). Because of its instability, distilled (or any essentially pure water) is never used directly. Tap water or other salts must first be added to it in order to increase its GH and KH.
   General hardness (GH) refers to the dissolved concentration of magnesium and calcium ions. When fish are said to prefer "soft" or "hard" water, it is GH (not KH) that is being referred to.

   Note: GH, KH and pH form the Bermuda's Triangle of water chemistry. Although the three properties are distinct, they all interact with each other to varying degrees, making it difficult to adjust one without impacting the other. That is one reason why beginning aquarists are advised NOT to tamper with these parameters unless absolutely necessary. As an example, "hard" water frequently often comes from limestone aquifers. Limestone contains calcium carbonate, which when dissolved in water increases both the GH (from calcium) and KH (from carbonate) components. Increasing the KH component also usually increases pH as well. Conceptually, the KH acts as a "sponge" absorbing the acid present in the water, raising the water's pH.

   Water hardness follows the following guidelines. The unit dH means "degree hardness", while ppm means "parts per million", which is roughly equivalent to mg/L in water. 1 unit dH equals 17.8 ppm CaCO3. Most test kits give the hardness in units of CaCO3; this means the hardness is equivalent to that much CaCO3 in water but does not mean it actually came from CaCO3.

         0 -  4 dH,    0 -   70 ppm : very soft
         4 -  8 dH,   70 -  140 ppm : soft
         8 - 12 dH,  140 -  210 ppm : medium hard
        12 - 18 dH,  210 -  320 ppm : fairly hard
        18 - 30 dH,  320 -  530 ppm : hard
        higher : liquid rock (Lake Malawi and Los Angeles, CA)

   Salinity refers to the total amount of dissolved substances. Salinity measurements count both GH and KH components as well as such other substances as sodium. Knowing water's salinity becomes important in salt water aquariums. In freshwater tanks, knowing pH, GH and KH suffices.

   Salinity is usually expressed in terms of its specific gravity, the ratio of a solution's weight to weight of an equal volume of distilled water. Because water expands when heated (changing its density), a common reference temperature of 39F degrees is used. Salinity is measured with a hydrometer, which is calibrated for use at a specific temperature (e.g., 75F degrees is common).

   One component of salinity that neither GH or KH includes is sodium. Some freshwater fish tolerate (or even prefer) a small amount of salt (it stimulates slime coat growth). Moreover, parasites (e.g., ick) do not tolerate salt at all. Thus, salt in concentrations of (up to) 1 tablespoon per 5 gallons can actually help prevent and cure ick and other parasitic infections.

   On the other hand, some species of fish do not tolerate ANY salt well. Scaleless fish (in general) and some Corydoras catfish are far more sensitive to salt than most freshwater fish. Add salt only if you are certain that all of your tank's inhabitants prefer it or can at least tolerate it.

What else do I need to know about water chemistry?

In addition to GH, KH, pH and salinity, there are a few other substances you may want to know about. Most tap water contains an assortment of trace elements in very low concentrations. The presence (or absence) of trace elements can be important in some situations. Specifically:

   Phosphates have been linked to algae growth. If you have persistant algae problems, high phosphates may be a contributing factor. In a plant tank, ideal phosphate levels are .2 mg/L or lower. To control algae, frequent partial water changes are often recommended to reduce nutrient levels. If your tap water contains excess phosphate, water changes may be aggrevating the situation. Your local water company can tell you what the exact phosphate levels are.

   Plants need iron in trace quanities to grow. Tap water in many areas contains no iron at all. Consult the Plant FAQ for more details.

How can I raise my GH and/or KH?
The following measurements are approximate; use a test kit to verify you've achieved the intended results.

To raise both GH and KH simultaneously, add calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Two teaspoons per 50 Liters of water will increase both the KH and GH by about 4 dH. Alternatively, add some sea shells, coral, limestone, marble chips, etc. to your filter.

To raise the KH without raising the GH, add sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), commonly known as baking soda. One teaspoon per 50 Liters raises the KH by about 4 dH. Sodium bicarbonate drives the pH towards an equilibrium value of 8.2.
How do I raise or lower pH?

One can raise or lower pH by adding chemicals. Because of buffering, however, the process is difficult to get right. Increasing or decreasing the pH (in a stable way) actually involves changing the KH. The most common approach is to add a buffer whose equilibrium holds the pH at the desired value.

Muriatic (hydrochloric) acid can be used to reduce pH. Note that the exact quantity needed depends on the water's buffering capacity. In effect, you add enough acid to use up all the buffering capacity. Once this has been done, decreasing the pH is easy. However, it should be noted that the resultant lower-pH water has much less KH buffering than it did before, making it more susceptible to pH swings when (say) nitrate levels rise. Warning: It goes without saying that acids are VERY dangerous! Do not use this approach unless you know what you are doing!

Products such as "pH-Down" are based on the acid phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid tends to keep the pH at roughly (6.5 ??? XXX). Unfortunately, use of phosphoric acid has the BIG side effect of raising the phosphate level in your tank, stimulating algae growth. It is difficult to control algae growth in a tank with elevated phosphate levels.

One safe way to lower pH WITHOUT adjusting KH is to bubble CO2 (carbon dioxide) through the tank. The CO2 dissolves in water, and some of it forms carbonic acid. The formation of acid lowers the pH. Of course, in order for this approach to be practical, a steady source of CO2 bubbles (e.g.. a CO2 tank) is needed to hold the pH in place. As soon as the CO2 is gone, the pH bounces back to its previous value. The high cost of a CO2 injection system precludes its use as a pH lowering technique in most aquariums. However CO2 injection systems are highly popular in heavily tanks, because the additional CO2 stimulates plant growth.
How do I soften water (e.g., lower its GH)?

Some fish (e.g., discus, cardinal tetras, etc.) prefer soft water. Althought they can survive in harder water, they are unlikely to breed. Thus, you may feel compelled to soften your water despite the hassle involved in doing so.

Typical home water softeners soften water using a technique known as "ion exchange". That is, they remove calcium and magnesium ions by replacing them with sodium ions. Although this does technically make water softer, most fish won't notice the difference. That is, fish that prefer soft water don't like sodium either, and for them such water softeners don't help at all. Thus, home water softeners are not an appropriate way to soften water for aquarium use.

Fish stores also market "water softening pillows". They use the same ion-exchange principle. One "recharges" the pillow by soaking it in a salt water solution, then places it in the tank where the sodium ions are released into the water and replaced by calcium and magnesium ions. After a few hours or days, the pillow (along with the calcium and magnesium) are removed, and the pillow recharged. The pillows sold in stores are too small to work well in practice, and shouldn't be used for the same reason cited above.

Peat moss softens water and reduces its hardness (GH). The most effective way to soften water via peat is to aerate water for 1-2 weeks in a bucket containing peat moss. For example, get a (plastic) bucket of the appropriate size. Then, get a large quantity of peat (gallon or more), boil it (so that it sinks), stuff it in a pillow case, and place it in the water bucket. Use an air pump to aerate it. In 1-2 weeks, the water will be softer and more acidic. Use this aged water when making partial water changes on your tank.

Peat can be bought at pet shops, but it is expensive. It is much more cost effective to buy it in bulk at a local gardening shop. Read labels carefully! You don't want to use peat containing fertilizers or other additives.

Although some folks place peat in the filters of their tanks, the technique has a number of drawbacks. First, peat clogs easily, so adding peat isn't always effective. Second, peat can be messy and may cloud the water in your tank. Third, the exact quantity of peat needed to effectively soften your water is difficult to estimate. Using the wrong amount results in the wrong water chemistry. Finally, when doing water changes, your tank's chemistry changes when new water is added (it has the wrong properties). Over the next few days, the chemistry changes as the peat takes effect. Using aged water helps ensure that the chemistry of your tank doesn't fluctuate while doing water changes.

Hard water can also be softened by diluting it with distilled water or R/O water. R/O (reverse-osmosis) water is purified water made by a R/O unit. Unfortunately, R/O units are too expensive ($100-$500) for most hobbiests. R/O water can also be purchased at some fish stores, but for most folks the expense and hassle are not worth it. The same applies to distilled water purchased at grocery stores.

# Parameters to be measured and their methods of testing

## Temperature

## pH

## Ammonia NH<sub>3</sub>
 - UV/Visible Spectrometer

## Carbonate

Whenever  the  pH  touches  8.3,  the  presence  of  carbonates  is  indicated.  It  is  measured  by titration  with  standardized  hydrochloric  acid  using  phenolphthalein  as  indicator.  Below  pH 8.3,  the  carbonates  are  converted  into  equivalent  amount  of  bicarbonates.  The  titration  can also be done pH metrically or potentiometrically. (From [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/P-Patil-4/publication/344375613_authors_-Licensee_IPA-Under_Creative_Commons_license_30_Physico-chemical_parameters_for_testing_of_water_-A_review/links/5f6db189299bf1b53ef0bb7f/authors-Licensee-IPA-Under-Creative-Commons-license-30-Physico-chemical-parameters-for-testing-of-water-A-review.pdf)  )

## Dissolved Oxygen

DO is one of the most important parameter.  Its correlation with water body  gives direct and indirect   information   e.g.   bacterial   activity,   photosynthesis,   availability   of   nutrients, stratification  etc.(Premlata  Vikal,  2009). In  the  progress  of  summer,  dissolved  oxygen decreased  due  to  increase  in  temperature  and  also  due  to  increased  microbial  activity  (Moss 1972,  Morrissette  1978,  Sangu  1987,  Kataria,  1996).   The  high  DO  in  summer  is  due  to increase  in  temperature  and  duration  of  bright  sunlight  has  influence  on  the  %  of  soluble gases  (O²  &  CO²).  During  summer  the  long  days  and  intense  sunlight  seem  to  accelerate photosynthesis  by  phytoplankton,  utilizing  CO2and  giving  off  oxygen.  This  possibly accounts  for  the  greater  qualities  of  O2recorded  during  summer  (Krishnamurthy  R,  1990). DO in sample is measured titrimetrically by Winkler’s method after 5 days incubation at 293 K.  The  difference  in  initial  and  final  DO  gives  the  amount  of  oxygen  consumed  by  the bacteria  during  this  period.  This  procedure  needs  special  BOD  bottles  which  seal  the  inside environment from atmospheric oxygen.

## Alkalinity

It  is  Composed  primarily  of  carbonate  (CO32-)  and  bicarbonate  (HCO3-),  alkalinity  acts  as  a stabilizer  for  pH.  Alkalinity,  pH  and  hardness  affect  the  toxicity  of  many  substances  in  the water. It is determined by simple dil HCl titration in presence of phenolphthalein and methyl orange indicators. Alkalinity in boiler water essentially results from the presence of hydroxyl and carbonate ions. Hydroxyl alkalinity (causticity ) in boiler water is necessary to protect the boiler  against  corrosion.  Too  high  a  causticity  causes  other  operating  problems,  such  as foaming. Excessively high causticity levels can result in a type of caustic attack of the boiler called "embrittlement".

## Carbon Dioxide
Carbon  dioxide  is  the  end  product  of  organic  carbon  degradation  in  almost  all  aquatic environments and its variation is often a measure of net  ecosystem metabolism(Smith 1997, 1993,  Hopkinson  1985).  Therefore,  in  aquatic  biogeochemical  studies,  it  is  desirable  to measure  parameters  that  define  the  carbon  dioxide  system.  CO2is  also  the  most  important green  house  gas  on  Earth.  Its  fluxes  across  the  air-water  or  sediment-water  interface  are among the most important concerns in  global  change studies  and are often a measure of the net ecosystem production/metabolism of the aquatic system.There  are  various  readily  measurable  parameters  of  aquatic  carbon  dioxide  system:  such  as pH  (pCO2),  total  dissolved  inorganic  carbon  (DIC)  and  total  alkalinity (TA).    Surface  water pCO2 can be measured by photometric method (DeGrandpre 1993, Wang, Z 2002) and DIC CO2is  measured  by  coulometer  or  by  an  infrared  CO2analyzer  (Dickson  1994).  Total Alkalinity  CO2is  determined  by  HCl  titration  of  the  water  sample  to the  CO2equivalence point.(Gran 1952).

## pH

pH is most important in determining the corrosive nature of water. Lower the pH value higher is the corrosive nature of water. pH was positively correlated with electrical conductance and total alkalinity(Guptaa 2009). The reduced rate of photosynthetic activity the assimilation of carbon dioxide and bicarbonates which are ultimately responsible for increase in pH, the low oxygen  values  coincided  with  high  temperature  during  the  summer  month.  Various  factors bring  about  changes  the  pH  of  water.  The  higher  pH  values  observed  suggests  that  carbon dioxide,  carbonate-bicarbonate  equilibrium  is  affected  more  due  to  change  in  physico-chemical condition (Karanth 1987).

## EC (Electrical Conductivity)

Conductivity  shows  significant  correlation  with  ten  parameters  such  as  temperature  ,  pH value  ,  alkalinity  ,  total  hardness  ,  calcium  ,  total  solids,  total  dissolved  solids  ,  chemical oxygen  demand  ,  chloride  and  iron  concentration  of  water.  Navneet  Kumar  et  al  (2010) suggested  that  the  underground  drinking  water  quality  of  study  area  can  be  checked effectively by controlling conductivity of water and this may also be applied to water quality managementof other study areas.  It is measured with the help of EC meter which measures the  resistance  offered  by  the  water  between  two  platinized  electrodes.  The  instrument  is standardized with known values of conductance observed with standard KCl solution.

[This](http://www.reefcentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1583884) page shows exactly how to do gH:

More accurate way to determine Alkalinity

After trying to get a accurate reading with my color titration Alkalinity test kit and failing. I can't tell the difference between the slight color changes. My gf gives a different reading than I do because we see the color differently. I just don't think those kits are very accurate. So I figure I have a digital pH meter why not do a HCL titration to saturate the alkalinity and calculate the amount of HCL used to get total alkalinity. Note: I am not a chemist but this is high school chemistry so if you are a chemist please take a look at my method and scrutinize.

The hard part; Making a 0.1 N solution of hydrochloric acid.

Grab a bottle of muriatic acid from your local home depot. Mine sells 20 baume 31.45% w/w HCl. Now we have to calculate the Morality of this solution. Most bottles will have a baume number on them. You will need this. To calculate the total weight of HCl in the bottle we take:

Specific gravity * %of HCl = g of HCl

Specific gravity can be found by 145/(145-baume).

So in my case I have a s.g. of

145/(145-20) = 1.16

Total HCl is 1.16 *1000 * .3145 = 364.82g HCl

Now I can find my morality, the molecular weight of HCl is 36.46g

364.82g/36.46g = 10 M

So in sort, the HCl home depot sells is 10 M. This is way too strong for practical purposes so we want to make a dilution of this for our titration. We are going to need a 0.1 N stock solution of HCl so first we will make a 1 N solution then make a 0.1 N solution from that. You should really make the stock solutions in phases like this for accuracy.

M1V1 = M2V2 we want to make a 1000ml 1 M solution from a 10 M so.

10x = 1 * 1000
x= 100 ml

So we add 100ml to 900ml of DI water (make sure your water reads 0 on your TDS meter.) and we get a 1 N stock solution. The pH of this solution should read 0.1 if your meter can handle this.

Now we do the same thing to make a .1 N solution from this solution. Letâ€™s make a 1000ml of this stuff so we donâ€™t have to do it again for a long time.

0.1*1000/1 = 100 ml. So add 100 ml of the 1N solution to 900 ml of DI water and you will finally have your stock solution!!! Measure the pH of this solution as a check. It should be 1.1 .

Easy part; Testing
Now take a sample of your aquarium water, you can use any volume but I like to use 100ml because my pH meter sits nicely in the cup without me holding it at this level. Stick in your pH meter to your sample. You should get the same reading you do when you stick it directly in your tank. If not start over with a clean sample container. Now draw up some 0.1 N HCl solution in to your 5ml syringe. And start dropping into your sample 0.5 mls at a time and watch your pH meter. You are adding a strong acid so your pH should fall rapidly. Once your pH hits 5 start to slow down and add a drop at a time until your pH hits 4.5 . The reason we are shooting for 4.5 is because this is the point where all available carbonates have been converted to carbonic acid. You would think this would be pH 7 but itâ€™s not as carbonic acid is a weak acid and you have to really saturate it etc. Anyway, once you have reached pH 4.5 you are done and now can calculate your total alkalinity.

Alk mg of CaC03 /L = A x N x 50,000 / mL of sample
Where A = ml of acid added
N = normality of your HCL

So if you added 4ml of 0.1 HCL before you hit a pH of 4.5

4*0.1*50,000 / 100 = 400 ppm CaC03 equivalents or your total alkalinity is 2 meg/L (mg/L / 50 = meg/L).

Very accurate! And cheaaap.

 FWIW, I show how to do such a titration with a standard acid here:

What is Alkalinity
http://www.advancedaquarist.com/2002/2/chemistry

Instead of pH 4.5, for seawater titrations you need to target about pH 4.2. At pH 4.5 in seawater, not all carbonate and bicarbonate have been converted to H2CO3. I discuss that in the article too.

One of the potential sources of error, aside from measurement difficulty is the variability in the acid concentration if you use a cheap bulk acid. that said, it may be a fine way to go.

I currently use a commercial standard acid to determine my alkalinity this way.

The preparation method of total water hardness test indicator
Affiliated technical field
The present invention relates to a kind of indicator and preparation thereof, particularly a kind of total water hardness test indicator and preparation thereof.
Background technology
The Accurate Determining of Drinking Water and process water hardness has become a water treatment supervision technical indicator routinely, important.The national standard of Drinking Water and process water Determination of Hardness has all been formulated in countries in the world.Standard GB/T/T6909-2008 < < boiler feed water of issue on 04 01st, 2008 and the mensuration > > of chilled water analytical approach hardness integrate GB/T6909.1-1986 < < boiler feed water and chilled water analytical approach Determination of Hardness high rigidity > > and GB/T6909.2-1986 < < boiler feed water and two standards of chilled water analytical approach Determination of Hardness soft > >, make its new standard be applicable to natural water, Drinking Water, industry softening water, boiler feed water and condensate water, the mensuration of the water sample hardness such as H type base exchanger water outlet.Its objective is the measurement range that expands the water hardness, from the formal bioassay standard of integrating the water hardness, but with regard to technical measures or two cover standards.The problem that this standard mainly exists is as follows: 1, system and the indicator of high hardness water assay method and low-hardness water assay method are different, and this just makes the lower limit of high hardness water assay method and the data of the low-hardness water assay method upper limit there is no reappearance or occur the blind spot on determination data.2, low-hardness water mensuration hardness indicator used is acid chrome blue K, and in complexometry, its theoretical color transition point is blue by red mutation.But the variable color of acid chrome blue K terminal, by purplish red to purplish blue, is visually difficult to control in actual titration.From the dynamic spectrum scan-data of titration overall process, analyze, the red maximum absorption wavelength 545nm of acid chrome blue K and complexing of metal ion is along with the carrying out of titration, redness weakens as purplish red, the disappearance at its this peak of 545nm lags behind, affect the hepatic observation of titration end-point 570nm, the i.e. bluish violet absorption maximum 570nm of free acid chrome blue K, aberration hop is not obvious, is visually difficult to control to cause the collimation error to reach 3mL or more.3, in low-hardness water Determination of Hardness, the selection of interfering ion screening agent, GB adopts before adding indicator with the Cys hydrochloride solution of 2ml and 2mL triethanolamine solution combines and shelters to eliminate interference.Its effect increases experimental cost, 68 yuan/mg of Cys; Secondly Cys is water insoluble, need be configured to the Cys hydrochloride solution of pH < 1, is easy to destroy the titration system of pH=8-10, causes the consequence of endless.

Remineralization of RO Water

https://skfaquatics.com/forum/forums/topic/7159-diy-remineralisation-for-ro-or-rain-water/

Here is my formula for re-mineralising RO or Rain water:



Powdered compound Grams needed:
|:---|---:|
Calcium Sulphate CaSO4
Heptahydrate (so it dissolves easily)
or Dihydrate if you can't find it, but dihydrate is not as soluble.
 58gm

Magnesium Sulphate (Epsom Salt) MgSO4 	37gm

Potassium Sulphate (aka Sulphate Of Potash) K2SO4 	11gm

Iron Sulphate (optional) FeSO4 	0.30gm

Manganese Sulphate (optional) MnSO4 	0.16gm

Total weight  	106.46gm



Multiply accordingly if you need to mix bigger batches.



Alternatively, Iron and Manganese can be replaced with a Micro-nutrient (trace element) mix of 0.46gm. Again micro nutrients or trace elements are optional, but a small amount of these minerals can be beneficial for shrimps. They will get it elsewhere if it is not added here.



You can either use it in powder form, adding small teaspoons to your water change until a TDS of 140-160 is reached.

OR

You can premix this in 500ml bottle of RO water, and drip it into your water change until the desired TDS 140-160 is reached.



If you have a TDS pen, you can check how much 1gm will raise TDS in 1L of water.

Similarly you can also test GH/KH raise in 1L of water.



It is very important you test this yourself, since there can be a number of variables between your mix and my mix.



This mix will not alter pH.

Alternatively, if you need a remin mix for Neocaridina or Tigers, you can replace 15g - 20g of Calcium Sulphate with Calcium Carbonate or Calcium chloride. Calcium chloride is probably easier to dissolve in water and that would be the preference.

This will raise KH a bit.
