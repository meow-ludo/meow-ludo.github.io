# Flag Fish

The American Flagfish (*Jordanella floridae*) is a freshwater [killifish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killifish) from Florida, USA.


## Interesting Aside:

Killifish are used extensively is [biogerontological research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killifish#In_lifespan_research) and we can extend their lifespan by over 50% using reservatrol. *[Northobranchius furzeri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothobranchius_furzeri)* is the shortest living vertebrate capable of being bred in captivity making it a useful model organism. It would be useful to make it transparent if possible.
